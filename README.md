# Football Visualisation

As an enthusiast of both data visualization and football, I've combined these passions using Python to create insightful and visually striking representations of raw football data.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For scripting the visualization logic.
- **Matplotlib & mplsoccer**: To create engaging and informative plots.

## Repository Structure (Still work in progress)
- `pass_network.py`: The main script for generating the pass network visualization.
- `data.json`: The data file containing pass network details.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install matplotlib mplsoccer`.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Run `python pass_network.py` to generate the visualization.

Feel free to explore the code and the visualisations it produces. Suggestions and collaborations are always welcome!
